# guessing-game-pug

This version of Guessing Game features the templating engine PUG and the CSS preprocesso-
r LESS.

PUG facilitates code reuasability and this iteration of Guessing Game demonstrates how
PUG does with the features block, include, mixins, and extend. Initially I wrote this
without the mixins, extends, and blocks. I enjoyed using Pug and was able to catch on to
the basics.

When I began reading about mixins, extends, etc. and began implenting them, I was
confused, slightly intimidated. I wasn't familiar with these terms, but I was able to
make some associations with other tools I worked with in the past and get up and 
running. I found the documentation extremely helpful.

LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) is a backwards compatible language extension for CSS.
LESS is just like CSS and makes it easy to pick up. LESS adds a few convenient additions
to the CSS language, which makes it easy to integrate into existing CSS.
I found it useful and reduced lines of code.

Similar to Pug, the concept of mixins, extends, etc. are present. I liked the parent selector
feature because I felt it brought some of my styling closer together.
At times I did find when nesting a lot with parent selectors, the style becomes harder to
follow.

 I like both Pug and LESS and would not mind using them again. I did feel quick and prod-
 uctive prototyping pages. I see the benefits of mixins, extends, and code reusability.
